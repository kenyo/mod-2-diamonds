## mod-2-final-project

The final project will focus on [kaggle's diamond data set](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds).
Based on the data I will build a model to predict the price of a diamond given its attributes.

#### Files:

* koh.ipynb: notebook containing the bulk of the work to fit/refit my models based on different feature selection techniques
* eda.ipynb: notebook containing all work done for EDA. 

#### Steps:

0: Read in data
1: Exploratory data analysis

2: Clean up any issues with the data like extreme values

3: Generate new features that you think could be important

* created polynomial features for continuous variables
* created dummy variables for categorical data [cut, clarity, color]

4: Train, test, split

5: Utilize some different feature selection techniques before or in conjuction with fitting your models

6: Evaluate your different models in order to determine the best model overall

7: Refit your best model to the entire dataset

#### Conclusions:

* color and clarity are two of the most important features that determine price other than carats
* carats influence the price of a diamond but there is large variance in price
